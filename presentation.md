## Motivation

At the beginning of the year: fires in Australia

^ During the lockdown: in Germany corona cases from Western Europe and China and US but not Eastern Europe
^ The news seem to be really biased
^ And if you do not actively try to be a "global citizen" and search for international news, you get stuck in your local/national bubble
^ This is dangerous, especially in the face of climate change (we need to care about all humans/ all creatures on earth and not only about our immediate surroundings?
Maybe then people would not go on the street in Berlin to demonstrate against wearing a mask in the supermarket if they understood how severe the situation is elsewhere?

## Data source

Using the API from different news ...?

Problem: not all countries are represented (especially Africa and Asia are missing)
But good for a start to test my pipeline

# at the end:
Get data from twitter tweets:
Is it used everywhere around the globe?
Not sure
But at least everyone can use it and probably the big newspapers of many countries use it

I am geographer and love to make maps! 
That is why my visualisation goal was to make a flow map
