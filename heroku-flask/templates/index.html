    <p id='description'>This visualization shows the result of an analysis of tweets from June 2020. 
      Teets were filtered by the following key conditions: that a foreign place (country or city) was 
      mentioned in the tweet text and the user location given could be indentified as a geographical 
      location. An arc line connecting two countries indicates that at least one tweet was sent 
      from one of the countries mentioning the other country or a city in the other country with 
      a population size larger than 900,000. </p>
